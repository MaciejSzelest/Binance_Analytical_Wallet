# BINANCE ANALYTICAL WALLET

OPEN-SOURCE BINANCE WALLET WITH DATA ANALYTICS AND FULL TRANSPARENCY

Hello,

I would like to present to you my open-source project for the crypto community. Based on my experience with Binance, I noticed that there is not too much control of the portfolio. So, I decided to create a solution for people like me who would like to understand how portfolio is changing, if there is a profit or loss, the history of transactions, and the purchase price history. That's why I created this project with the use of the dash library. 

From a user perspective, you need to create your API keys on the Binance page. You need to add them as environmental variables in Pycharm and install all libraries from the requirements file. In the data file, you need to provide four cryptocurrency symbols that you would like to see on your page. Please keep in mind that only your Spot transactions will be visible on the page. 

Thanks to the Heroku platform, you can easily and free of charge build, run, and operate your Binance Wallet entirely in the cloud, link below:

If you would like to see how this project looks like, I would like to invite you to my personal page, link below:
